# Giveaway Countdown

Stylish watch giveaway countdown timer made with JavaScript. A great project to practice JavaScript date methods and objects!

# Built With

<li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
<li>CSS custom properties</li>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>JavaScript Date methods</li>

# What I learned

I had a chance to practice JavaScript Date object and methods like getFullYear(), getMonth(), getDate(), getHours() and even getMinutes(). I also made sure that once the timing is 0 it resets and starts the counter again, so I don't have to keep updating the project.

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - is a great tool to create the design beforehand.
2. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">MDN Web Docs</a> - a place where you can read more about Date methods.
